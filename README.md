# PassIFox and chromeIPass

are extensions to integrate [KeePass](http://keepass.info)/[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) as a password manager with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.

They require [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/), a KeePass plugin to expose password entries securely (256bit AES/CBC) over HTTP.
