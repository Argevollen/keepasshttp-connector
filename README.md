# KeePassHttp-Connector

is an extension to integrate [KeePass](http://keepass.info)/[KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) as a password manager with Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.

They require [KeePassHttp](https://github.com/pfn/keepasshttp/), a KeePass plugin to expose password entries securely (256bit AES/CBC) over HTTP.

It was forked from [chromeIPass/passIFox](https://github.com/pfn/passifox), with support for newer versions of Firefox (42+).
